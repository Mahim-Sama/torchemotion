torchemotion: a speech emotion library for PyTorch
========================================

The aim of torchemotion is to apply [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [torchaudio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio) to the speech emotion recognition domain. We begin with providing basic dataloaders to read popular emotional datasets.
